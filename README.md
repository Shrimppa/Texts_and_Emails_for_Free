# Overview

This software can be used to connect communities, and their members easily, and for free!

This software lets you send emails, and texts out for free.

I wrote this software because you can't find a solution to this problem usually, unless you pay lots of money to someone who provides the service, and so I set out to make a open source tool to do it for free.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to build this project, and Visual Studio to use Nukita.

I used Python as the development language.

I used two python libraries: smtplib, csv

In order to package it into a .exe I used Nukita which cross compiles your app into C++ then compiles that to create a signed *.exe binary.
